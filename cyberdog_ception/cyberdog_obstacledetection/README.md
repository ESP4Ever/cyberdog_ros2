#cyberdog_ObstacleDetection
This module creates the service and publisher of Ultrasonic Sensor in the robot perception system. This module supports information perception from two sensors at the same time, but currently the robot system hardware is only adapted to the Head Ultrasonic Sensor. When the robot needs to perform automatic obstacle avoidance function, the service and publisher can be started through the upper decision-making layer or other modules to obtain the distance information of surrounding obstacles.
